**Working with Files**

The logic of the software operation is that data correspondence in all files is line-by-line. That is, the Profile at index 0 will work with information from lines at index 0, the profile at index 5 will work with lines at index 5, and so on.

Therefore, all files must have the same number of lines to work correctly.

First, run in **Setup Profiles & Accounts** mode to log in or register accounts. Once the profiles are created, run in **Open Range of Accs** or **Open Accs List** mode.

**Important! The software will not be able to log in to the Eclipse server, so the account must already be there in advance**

**Files that need to be filled out**

- `privates.txt` - Private keys of your accounts.
- `proxies.txt` - proxies in the format `login:password@ip:port`.
- `invites.txt` - You can put either your invites here or collect new ones with the software from new accounts.
- `discords.txt` - dis tokens.
- `twitters.txt` - twitter tokens.
